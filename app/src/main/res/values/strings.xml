    <string name="blogpost_details">
        I\'ve been watching some extremely good shows lately. I should share my opinions on at least one of them.
        I\'m mostly an anime watcher, but I guess it wouldn\'t hurt to smuggle in an indie-animated show for a change.
        For the former, I\'d probably write about My Hero Academia, for the latter I\'d write about Murder Drones. Both of them
        are 10/10s.
        \n\n
        Things to include in the blog post:\n
        - Plot summary\n
        - Animation quality and visual design\n
        - Character discussions; who I like, who I don\'t like\n
        - Soundtrack!!!\n
        - Overall score out of 10\n

    <string name="assignment">Finish programming assignment</string>

    <string name="assignment_details">
        We\'re supposed to build a tiny Unix shell using C, but it\'s proving a lot more challenging than I thought it\'d be.
        My implementation\'s batch mode does not seem to be working, and it seems to be an issue with the file reading itself,
        especially at the end…
        \n\n
        UPDATE: After talking it out with my dad, he proposed an excellent idea. Instead of reading the file for a single line
        and then parsing it to execute that line\'s commands before moving on to the next line, why don\'t I just read the entire
        file and store each line in a massive array of character arrays? That way I can read the file once at the beginning of
        runtime and then be done with it. That should take care of the batch mode bug. Just gotta get to coding it!

        The plot thickens, and things are getting interesting. Mad-Eye Moody is an interesting character to say the least but
        he\'s quickly becoming one of my favorites. That scene with Draco in chapter 13 was funny as hell.

    <string name="course_details">
        I\'m taking a Java programming course on the side, need to continue… Having taken programming courses with
        C++ and Python before, I really only have to learn the syntax, but it can still be a challenge with how cluttery
        Java\'s syntax can be.

        Call my mother and catch up, while also reassuring her. She is out of work at about 7 or 8 P.M.,
        so that is my cue to call her and ask how she has been. I should probably remind her of the upcoming
        family dinner too.
